## PROJECT AND COMPETITION
**Columbia University** <span style="float: right; font-weight: bold;">New York, NY</span>

<i>Autism Project </i> <span style="float: right;">Nov, 2023 - present</span>

- The project focuses on new-born infants to discover the associations between infantsâ€™ behaviors and different features including demographic information, anthropomentrics etc..
- Conduct data cleaning and achieve a longitudinal dataset with 370 variables. Apply Principle Component Analysis for each time spot(3mo/6mo/9mo) to find the potential correlation among the predictors.

**University Of Michigan** <span style="float: right; font-weight: bold;">Ann Arbor, MI</span>

<i>Statistics-based XAI approach for neural network decision analysis</i> <span style="float: right;">Jul, 2023 - Dec.2023</span>

- Introduce a pedagogical approach applying PCA and MLR to simulate and interpret the inner structure of Neuron Networks working on 2D image.

- **Results:** Successfully establish a neural network interpretation framework for hand-written digit recognition. Methods proven with higher accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity to global and local texture information compared with the existing method.

<i>Experimenting escaping behavior of larvae under repetitive weak stimulation</i> <span style="float: right;">May, 2022 - May, 2023</span>

- Collected virgins, planned on hybridization, prepared ATR food and designed genotypes of both a control group and an experimental group; Conducted escaping behavioral experiments working on hundreds of data. Took care of larvae stocks, and autoclaved the pipettes;

- **Results:** There is no sufficient evidence to draw on the correlation between escaping behavior and repetitive weak stimulation for a specific range of spectrum. However, different light compositions could still play a role in shaping the escaping behavior of larvae.

<i>Mask R-CNN for rat behavior identification</i> <span style="float: right;">May, 2022 - Nov, 2022</span>

- Wrote codes for the entire program and processed each frameimage of the video with Python (using VIA to mark an object within a frame and then generate a JSON file), created train and validation groups, conducted training by using the pre-trained COCO dataset with Mask R-CNN

- **Results:** The shape of the mouse could be masked in the motion video, with an accuracy over 0.7 which potentially leads to new approach of Detectron2.
